# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement

Evaluating the flight stability and performance characteristics of an aircraft requires knowledge of multiple aerodynamic parameters such as center of gravity position, neutral point, lift coefficient and stall speed. These calculations are often done manually or through advanced tools, which may not be accessible to students or early-stage developers. There is a need for a simplified computational program that can analyze fundamental stability metrics and assist in the preliminary assessment of an aircraft or UAV design.

## 2. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

- Implementing a computational tool using Java for aircraft stability and basic performance analysis.
- Performing calculations for static margin, lift coefficient, stall speed and takeoff feasibility.
- Providing result interpretation based on computed values.
- Logging calculation results into a CSV file for comparison and review.

The project does not include CFD simulations, dynamic stability analysis, real-time physics simulation or aerodynamic modeling beyond simplified formula-based computation.

## 3. Target Users

This system is intended to be used by:

- Students studying aerospace or aeronautical engineering.
- Individuals designing basic aircraft or UAV systems.
- Researchers needing quick conceptual-level analysis.
- Anyone requiring a lightweight stability-check tool without advanced software.

## 4. High-Level Features

The project includes the following high-level functional components:

- User input interface to enter aircraft configuration parameters.
- Calculation module to compute aerodynamic stability and performance metrics.
- Output and decision logic to classify results (stable/unstable, takeoff possible or not).
- Data logging system to store computed results in a structured CSV format.

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

- Standard sea-level atmospheric density (ρ = 1.225 kg/m³) is assumed unless specified otherwise.
- The model is intended for fixed-wing aircraft and not applicable to rotary-wing systems.
- User inputs are assumed to be physically meaningful values within practical aircraft design ranges.

---

## 6. Expected Outcome

The final system will provide a simplified but meaningful evaluation of whether an aircraft configuration is:

- Aerodynamically stable
- Able to generate sufficient lift
- Within safe stall limits
- Capable of achieving takeoff with the available runway length

The program output will assist users in making initial design decisions without requiring advanced simulation platforms.
